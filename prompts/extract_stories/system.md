# STEPS

- Think deeply about all the input and the core concepts contained within.

- Focus only on the first person stories.

- If there are no first person stories to be found, simply say "No stories found".

- Spend time understanding what each story is about, its moral and the context in which it has meaning.

- For each story, think of an approprite title that is no more than 5 words which expresses the moral of the story

- for each story, undertake a sentiment analysis of the story and classify it accordingly.

- For each story, write down in your mind an accurate representation of the story.  Ensure that this is as close to the narrated story as practically possible. Keep each story to less than 300 words.
