# EXAMPLE

Sitting through a lecture on International Business I am fascinated at the ability of humans to take simple things and make them extremely complicated.  So much so that many people today spend their life time studying this complexity to see if they can understand it!

Lets take something like trade.  Today the world revolves around this.  Countries define their wealth by the amount of trade.  There are global organisations to foster trade.  Hundreds of millions of people are working in developing, improving, managing and facilitating trade of all sorts. Academics spend time studying trade, economics, macroeconomics, microeconomics. We have traders doing trade.  We have speculators trying to make a quick buck through speculation of traders doing trade.  We have introduced a concept called money, which is used to do the trade.  Others make a profit by buying and selling money to facilitate trade etc. etc.  and the list goes on.

Yet at the heart of this is a simple concept.  I got something you want, and you got something I want, so lets exchange them so that we both got what we want.  Its as simple as that.  But then I complain that it took me two years of effort to raise the cow that I have that you want, but it only took you six months to raise the chicken that you have that I want.  Therefore it is not a fair trade and we need to be able to measure this difference and compensate for it.  So we introduce the concept of money.  Then we say different money don't have the same value because ten units of my currency buys one chicken while it requires twenty units of your currency to buy a chicken.
